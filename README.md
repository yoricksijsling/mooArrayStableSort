Array.stableSort
================

Adds a stable sort function to Google Chrome and other browsers
A stable sort behaves more intuitive when you're sorting a dataset multiple times on different keys (e.g. a sortable table) and the result is always predictable.

Notes
-----

More information on stable sorting on <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability>

Only Chrome and old versions of Firefox(< 3) and Opera(< 10) use an unstable sort algorithm. All other browsers (at least Firefox 3+, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera 10+) use a stable sort.

It's implemented using a merge sort. In Chrome 5 it's about half as fast as the default sort (firefox and opera are slower). Time complexity is the same, O(n log n). The default sort will be used whenever possible.

How to use
----------

You'll need an array with test data

	var myArray = [ [1,5], [3,3], [2,7], [1,4], [1,8]];

Now sort on the first item
	myArray.stableSort(function(a,b) {
		return a[0] > b[0] ? 1 : (a[0] < b[0] ? -1 : 0);
	});

Result
	[ [1,5], [1,4], [1,8], [2,7], [3,3] ];

Note that an unstable sort algorithm might just as well have given any of these
	[ [1,4], [1,8], [1,5], [2,7], [3,3] ];
	[ [1,8], [1,4], [1,5], [2,7], [3,3] ];
	[ [1,4], [1,5], [1,8], [2,7], [3,3] ];
	...
